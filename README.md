## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 16/05/2025
# Reg. No. : 212222060185

## Aim
The experiment aims to explore how different prompt styles influence AIgenerated audio, such as music, sound effects, and speech. It focuses on
understanding prompt engineering and optimizing prompt design for better and
more relevant outputs.

## Software Requirements
Sound Effects Eleven labs

## Procedure:

Tool Selection:

o Choose one or more AI audio generation platforms (e.g.,
Soundraw, ElevenLabs, Google Magenta).

Prompt Design:

o Design both general and specific prompts for each
category: music, sound effects, and speech.

o Examples:

General: "Make a melody."
Specific: "A chill lo-fi hip-hop beat with soft piano chords, vinyl crackle,
and mellow synths. Perfect for studying or relaxing."

## Audio Generation:

o Use the tools to generate audio based on the designed
prompts.

 Observation & Comparison:
 
o Compare general vs. specific prompt results in terms of
quality, relevance, tone, and clarity.
o Note improvements when prompts are revised for better
structure.

 Iteration:
 
o Modify prompts and regenerate audio to refine the result.
o Document how small prompt changes impact the final
output.
